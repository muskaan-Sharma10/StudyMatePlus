# 📘 StudyMatePlus

🔗 **Live Website**: [https://studymateplus.vercel.app](https://studymateplus.vercel.app)

**StudyMatePlus** is an open-source platform designed to help college students access academic resources such as **syllabus**, **previous year question papers (PYQs)**, and **exam feedback**, along with an option to connect with **seniors** for guidance.
The goal is to support students during exam preparation by providing a centralized, reliable, and user-friendly resource hub.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Students often face difficulty finding authentic academic materials in one place. Information like syllabus PDFs, PYQs, and exam tips are scattered or unavailable. This project aims to build a platform that:

* Organizes syllabus and PYQs department-wise
* Includes student feedback on exam papers (e.g., difficulty levels, important topics)
* Connects juniors with seniors for mentoring and doubt clearing
* Supports **multiple universities and departments** in one place

---

## 🌟 Key Features (To Be Developed)

* ✅ Filter syllabus and papers by **university**, **semester**, **subject**
* ✅ **Student feedback** section for each paper (e.g., "Paper was tricky — focus on Unit 2")
* ✅ Secure **senior-student chat** or forum system
* ✅ Upload and browse **notes, guides, and important questions**
* ✅ Clean and **mobile-friendly** interface
